**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Stremio should not cancel categories when "new" is selected. Currently, when I choose "sci-fi" from movies and then "new", it cancels the sci-fi category and mixes up movies. It would make more sense, when choosing "new", only sci-fi movies remained and Stremio lists them based on release date, descending
